# CoCopilot

### Some things are more effective the simpler they are, like this little tool, I can't say what it's for.

####  This project is just to help you authorize, there is no risk of data/code leakage.


1. Use `JetBrains` suite IDE and install `Copilot` plugin.
2. For `Windows` system, run `cocopilot.bat`
3. For `macOS/Linux` system, run `cocopilot.sh`
4. If you see `done. please restart your ide.`, it means success.
5. Just restart your IDE. This method also works for `Vim/NeoVim`
6. This is a little toy, may not be thoroughly tested, don't blame me.


#### For VSCode, the steps are basically the same. Execute the corresponding vscode.sh/vscode.bat (if you are using VSCode to remotely connect to an Ubuntu server and the copilot extension is installed on the remote server, you need to execute vscode-remote.sh), **no need to execute**`cocopilot.sh`/`cocopilot.bat`ã€‚
#### `After updating plugins in `VSCode`, you need to rerun the script, while for JetBrains, it is not necessary.
